# Xavi Ablaza—@xaviablaza
Hi, I'm Xavi! I'm a software engineer at [Touch of Modern](https://www.touchofmodern.com/), a curated, online shopping destination for men to discover extraordinary products to elevate their lifestyle. Previously, I led consultancy efforts at the [User Experience Society](https://uxsociety.org). Before that, I worked in fintech at [Bloom Solutions](https://bloom.solutions) focusing on blockchain-powered money remittance. I'm a huge nerd/geek and computer gamer. 💕

## What tech I use
🌟 Ruby<br>
💖 Crystal<br>
🍏 Kubernetes<br>

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸
